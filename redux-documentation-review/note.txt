Redux Toolkit API :
simplifys standard Redux tasks.(automatic reducers, middlware, devtools, redux-thunk)
All of the action creators and action types are generated 
automatically, and the reducer code is shorter and easier to understand. 

 > configureStore  : sets up the store.
 > createSlice     : creates reducers. (name, initial state, reducer functions)
 > 

Packages
- @reduxjs/toolkit  {configureStore, createSlice, createReducer, }
- redux > is obsolete and should be avoided.
- react-redux   {Provider, useSelector, useDispatch }
